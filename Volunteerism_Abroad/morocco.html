                <p class="text-justify">Morocco is a culturally rich and exciting country. We pride ourselves on being very selective when choosing a country for Volunteerism Abroad, and Morocco truly offers so much for our volunteers. The country is easily accessible due to its proximity to Europe, it has good public transit systems, and its all around affordability helps make this a very tangible place to enter. Along with being a beautiful and exotic location, Morocco is a country full of passionate and hospitable people. This country and it's people have always left us with more than we can give back.</p>

                    <h3>VOLUNTEERING IN MORROCO</h3>

                    <p class="text-justify">Programs in <a id="style_anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco" target="_blank">Morocco</a> are all focused in the Rabat–Salé metroplex. Both <a id="style_anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat" target="_blank">Rabat</a> and <a id="style_anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal%C3%A9" target="_blank">Salé</a> are great places to explore and are actually less touristic then many other cities in Morocco. This not only provides a more comfortable living environment for foreigners, but also allows for a much more authentic experience. From here you have easy access to the rest of the country and the more touristic or scenic places you might want to visit during your stay. The Moroccan government is actually based out of Rabat. This helps give our volunteers the opportunity to be involved with more impactful projects, as well as live in a more cosmopolitan environment with access to services volunteers might want or need. As mentioned on the main page Morocco is very affordable. For example, the 4 and a half hour train ride from Rabat to Marrakesh should set you back about 10-14 US dollars. A meal at a nice restaurant could set you back 5 US dollars. You can usually find a nice hostel for about 5-10 US dollars in touristic places. We encourage our volunteers to get out and explore as much as they can. Morocco is full of amazing places that won’t break the bank!</p>

                    <h3>WHERE WILL I STAY?</h3>

                    <p class="text-justify">While staying in Morocco you have two choices. You can rent an apartment, or you can live with a host family. We highly recommend staying with a host family for a truly Moroccan experience. We feel you should go outside your comfort zone to choose a place that takes you away from your home culture. If you are volunteering for an extended amount of time, you can start with a homestay for the first portion of your experience to decide if you just can’t go on with life without your host family or if you'd prefer a space of your own.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">We offer a wide range of projects that center mostly around the country’s capital city, Rabat. Our projects include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Teaching English:</strong> Volunteers, with the support of Moroccan teachers, will have the opportunity to teach and lead classes of their own. Teaching languages is the primary focus, but depending on the need from local teachers classes on other topics could possibly be arranged. Most of the students will have a basic to intermediate skill level of the language you’re teaching.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Helping People with Disabilities:</strong> Volunteers will work with different types of needs from basic life skills to actual educational curriculum. The students here have a wide range of mental or physical disabilities ranging from moderate to severe. The circumstances here are probably different than you are accustomed to, being that in Morocco it is not easy for families to find support and services for people with special needs.</li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Women's Empowerment Programs:</strong> Although many steps have been made to better the lives of women in Morocco, there is still ample room for improvement. Volunteers will have the opportunity to work with local organizations that support women and work to help women’s inequality issues in the country.</li>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Strengthening Local NGOs:</strong> These Non Government Organizations deal with a wide range of work mostly dealing with civil rights issues and helping provide services to Morocco’s poor. Many of the NGOs are new and need as much support as they can to get themselves running at their full potential. Volunteers can expect to help with project ideas, event planning, marketing, public relations, writing grants, or simple administrative work.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p class="text-justify">Due to our wonderful partners in Morocco, it’s possible we can arrange customized projects for large groups. <a href="mailto:hello@volunteerismabroad.com?subject=Customized Volunteering Projects">Shoot us an email</a>, and we will try our best to make something happen!</p>
